<br/>

TheClassJoiner is an <strong>Executable Jar File</strong> which will <strong>automatically</strong> join and leave my classes for me.
It is all created in Java. 

Java 8u311 (jre1.8.0_311) and JDK 17.0.1 (jdk-17.0.1) were created to use this file.

To run the file, you need to use the following command with the arguements.
  start javaw -jar --enable-preview TheClassJoiner.jar

The jar will keep running in the background till school comes to an end (2PM)
